<h2>About Accessible Tech Labs India</h2>

<p>
Accessible Tech Labs India is an independent technology initiative created by a blind developer with a strong focus on accessibility, simplicity, and practical software development.

This platform exists to build tools that are usable by everyone, especially screen reader users and beginners in technology. Every project is carefully designed to work smoothly with keyboard navigation and assistive technologies.
