<h2>Website Blocker</h2>
<p>
Website Blocker is a system-level Windows utility that allows users to block selected websites across all browsers and applications using HOSTS file and firewall logic. It provides complete control over internet access in focus environments, productivity setups, and controlled systems.
The tool supports blocking individual domains, viewing currently blocked websites, bulk unblocking, and full internet lock mode. Designed with accessibility in mind, it offers keyboard-driven menus and professional confirmation messages to prevent accidental misconfiguration.
Website Blocker works fully offline and requires administrator privileges for safe operation. It is ideal for parental supervision, study environments, and users who want to limit distractions or manage system-wide connectivity.
</p>
<h3>Command-Line Website Blocker (Advanced / Power Users)</h3>
<p>
This version of Website Blocker is a fully command-line based utility designed for users who prefer direct system control, automation, and script-driven workflows. It operates entirely through keyboard input and text-based menus, making it highly suitable for screen reader users who rely on predictable command-line environments. The tool interacts directly with system-level configurations such as the Windows HOSTS file and firewall rules to ensure that blocked websites remain inaccessible across all browsers and applications.
The command-line Website Blocker provides granular control over individual domains, allowing users to add, remove, review, and bulk manage blocked websites with clear confirmation prompts at every step. All actions are announced through structured output messages, ensuring that users always understand what operation is being performed and what changes are applied to the system. This version is especially useful for advanced users, system administrators, educational environments, and accessibility-focused setups where graphical interfaces are unnecessary or undesirable.
Because the tool runs completely offline, it does not depend on external services or background processes. Administrator privileges are required to ensure system safety and prevent partial configuration changes. This command-line edition emphasizes reliability, transparency, and full keyboard accessibility, staying true to the accessibility-first philosophy of Accessible Tech Labs India.

<h3>Professional Website Blocker Installer (GUI Version)</h3>
<p>
The Professional Website Blocker Installer is a fully graphical, installer-based application created using AutoHotkey to deliver a modern, user-friendly, and professional experience. Unlike the command-line version, this edition provides a real Windows application with a guided interface, clear buttons, structured dialogs, and spoken feedback messages. It is designed for users who prefer a visual and interactive setup while still maintaining full accessibility and keyboard navigation.
This version includes an installer that guides users through setup, ensures proper system permissions, and configures blocking features safely and reliably. The graphical interface allows users to block and unblock websites without manually entering commands, reducing the risk of configuration errors. Every action is confirmed through professional status messages, and the interface is optimized for screen readers such as NVDA, ensuring a smooth experience for blind and low-vision users.
The installer-based Website Blocker is ideal for general users, educational institutions, productivity-focused environments, and anyone seeking a polished, professional application rather than a command-line utility. Like all tools from Accessible Tech Labs India, it works fully offline after installation, respects user privacy, and does not include background services or tracking components.
