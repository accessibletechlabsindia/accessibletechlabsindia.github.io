This version operates entirely through a structured command-line interface, providing predictable menus and clear screen reader friendly output. It allows users to convert audio files into video format using solid background colours or custom images, and also extract audio from video files with simple guided prompts. The CLI edition supports MP3, WAV, and MP4 formats and runs completely offline using embedded processing engines. Every step is clearly announced through text prompts optimized for NVDA and other screen readers. No graphical interface is required, ensuring fast execution, minimal system usage, and distraction-free workflows. This version is ideal for advanced users, automation scenarios, scripting environments, and users who prefer direct system control without visual complexity. It maintains file integrity, does not modify original content, and ensures reliable output generation in a professional and structured manner. </p> <p> <a href="https://github.com/accessibletechlabsindia/accessibletechlabsindia.github.io/releases/download/v1.0-audio-to-video/AudioVideoConverter.exe"> Download Command-Line Media Composer Engine </a> </p> <h3>Professional Media Composer Engine Installer (GUI Version)</h3> <p> The Professional Media Composer Engine is a fully graphical Windows application developed to provide a modern, polished, and installer-based experience. Unlike the command-line edition, this version offers a structured visual interface with guided buttons, organized layouts, and real-time feedback. Built with accessibility as a core principle, the interface remains fully keyboard navigable and screen reader compatible while delivering a professional desktop application experience. This edition includes a proper installer that configures the application safely and integrates it into the Windows environment. Users can convert audio to video, extract audio from video files, select background colours, use custom images, and manage output settings without typing commands. The application provides status updates, safe processing, and structured confirmation messages to ensure clarity at every stage. It is designed for content creators, students, educators, and visually impaired users who prefer a real application environment rather than a terminal-based workflow. Like all tools from Accessible Tech Labs India, it works completely offline after installation, respects privacy, and does not include telemetry or background services. </p> <p> <a href="https://github.com/accessibletechlabsindia/accessibletechlabsindia.github.io/releases/download/v1.1.1/Media.Composer.Engine.exe">
