<h1>YouTube Downloader – Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how the YouTube Downloader application developed by Accessible Tech Labs India collects, uses, and protects user information. Your privacy and data security are extremely important to us. This application is designed to function locally on your device and does not collect personal data without your knowledge.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>
The YouTube Downloader application does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information such as name, email address, passwords, browsing history, or financial details. All downloads are processed directly between your device and the YouTube platform using the yt-dlp engine. The application itself does not maintain any external server connection for storing user data.
</p>

<h2>Local File Storage</h2>
<p>
Downloaded audio and video files are saved only to your selected local download directory. The application does not upload, transmit, or sync your files to any remote server. All processing is performed locally using ffmpeg and yt-dlp tools installed within the application folder.
</p>

<h2>Internet Usage</h2>
<p>
Internet access is required solely for downloading media content and checking software updates for yt-dlp. During update checks, the application may connect to official GitHub repositories to verify the latest version. No personal device information is transmitted during this process.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Tools</h2>
<p>
This application uses open-source tools such as yt-dlp and ffmpeg. These tools operate independently and are governed by their own licenses. We do not modify or track the behavior of these tools beyond their standard operation.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
We implement reasonable safeguards to ensure that the application runs securely. Since the software does not store sensitive personal data, risks related to data leakage are minimal. Users are responsible for ensuring safe internet practices and lawful usage of downloaded content.
</p>

<h2>Policy Updates</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated in future versions of the application to reflect improvements or new features. Any changes will be published within the application settings section.
