It allows users to download educational content, lectures, playlists, and audio files directly to their Windows system in a simple and structured way. Designed with clarity, predictable navigation, and professional feedback messages, this tool ensures users always understand what is happening during the download process. Both command-line and installer-based versions are available, giving users flexibility depending on their technical comfort level. All processing happens locally on your system without relying on online converters, helping maintain privacy and performance. </p> <hr> <h3>Command-Line Edition (Advanced / Technical Users)</h3> <p> The Command-Line Edition of YouTube Downloader is a lightweight, keyboard-driven utility built for users who prefer direct system interaction and script-based workflows. This version operates entirely inside a structured menu environment, making it highly compatible with screen readers such as NVDA. Users simply paste a video, playlist, or channel link and choose the desired format such as MP3 or MP4. The tool automatically handles download processing, file conversion, and folder organization without requiring additional steps. </p> <p> This edition supports audio extraction, full video downloads, playlist handling, and automatic folder creation for organized storage. It is ideal for advanced users and those who prefer minimal graphical overhead. Clear progress messages and confirmation prompts ensure that users always know the current status of downloads. </p> <h4>Version 1.0 (Command-Line Stable Release)</h4> <p> Version 1.0 of the Command-Line Edition is considered stable for structured accessibility workflows. Core download logic, format conversion, and folder management are fully operational. The interface remains lightweight and predictable for screen reader users. While this edition is stable and reliable, users seeking a more modern interface, built-in update system, and simplified navigation are recommended to use the Professional Installer Edition below. </p> <p> <a href="https://github.com/accessibletechlabsindia/accessibletechlabsindia.github.io/releases/download/v1.0-youtube-downloader/youtube.downloader.exe"> Download Command-Line Edition </a> </p> <hr> <h3>Professional Installer Edition (Graphical Application)</h3> <p> The Professional Installer Edition is a fully graphical Windows application developed to provide a modern, user-friendly experience without requiring command-line interaction. This version includes a real installer package that guides users through setup and ensures proper system configuration. Unlike the CLI version, this edition provides buttons, dialogs, structured interface elements, and simplified workflow navigation while still remaining fully accessible. </p> <p> This edition includes an integrated update system that allows the application to check for newer versions and notify users directly inside the program interface. Users do not need to manually download updates from the website. The graphical interface simplifies format selection, link pasting, download location management, and status monitoring. It is optimized for screen reader compatibility while also providing a clean visual layout for sighted users. </p> <h4>Version 1.2 – Stable Professional Release</h4> <p> Version 1.2 represents a major stability improvement over the earlier professional release. In Version 1.0, several minor bugs affected download reliability, format selection accuracy, and certain edge-case error responses. These issues have now been fully resolved. The update includes improved download engine stability, better error handling, enhanced progress feedback messages, and smoother integration of the built-in update system.
This release also strengthens internal validation checks to prevent corrupted downloads and ensures more consistent behavior across different Windows environments. Performance optimizations reduce processing delays and improve responsiveness for both blind and sighted users. All known errors from earlier builds have been corrected, and the application is now considered fully stable for daily use. Users are strongly recommended to install Version 1.2 for the most reliable and professional experience.
