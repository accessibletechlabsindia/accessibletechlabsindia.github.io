<h3>Command-Line Edition (Advanced / Technical Users)</h3>

<p>
The Command-Line Edition of YouTube Downloader is a lightweight, keyboard-driven utility built for users who prefer direct system interaction and script-based workflows. This version operates entirely inside a structured menu environment, making it highly compatible with screen readers such as NVDA. Users simply paste a video, playlist, or channel link and choose the desired format such as MP3 or MP4. The tool automatically handles download processing, file conversion, and folder organization without requiring additional steps.
</p>

<p>
This edition supports audio extraction, full video downloads, playlist handling, and automatic folder creation for organized storage. It is ideal for advanced users and those who prefer minimal graphical overhead. Clear progress messages and confirmation prompts ensure that users always know the current status of downloads. This version is stable, reliable, and suitable for users comfortable with command-line workflows. However, for the best experience, the Professional Installer Edition below is strongly recommended.
